# Breeze Enhancement Context

This document captures the implementation context for adding reranking, tree-sitter snippets, gitignore support, and improved content detection to Breeze.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks

2. **Dependencies Updated** - Added gitignore_parser, tree-sitter-languages to pyproject.toml
3. **Content Detection** - Implemented hyperpolyglot-based detection in `breeze/core/content_detection.py`
4. **Gitignore Support** - Added gitignore filtering to `_walk_directory_fast()` in engine.py
5. **Tree-sitter Snippet Extraction** - Implemented `TreeSitterSnippetExtractor` in `breeze/core/snippets.py`
6. **Tree-sitter Query Files** - Created proper query files for semantic extraction in `breeze/core/tree_sitter_queries.py`
7. **Reranker Configuration** - Added reranker fields to BreezeConfig
8. **Batch Size Configuration** - Made batch sizes configurable instead of hardcoded
9. **Reranking Pipeline** - Implemented support for Voyage, Gemini, and local rerankers in search()
10. **Pre-chunking for Local Models** - Added AutoTokenizer support for local embedding models
11. **Test Creation** - Written comprehensive tests for gitignore filtering and reranking

13. **Rate Limiting Test Consolidation** - Consolidated redundant rate limiting tests

### ðŸš§ Pending Tasks

1. **Enhance chunking to use tree-sitter for semantic boundaries** (functions/classes)
2. **Refactor search logic** out of engine.py into separate search module
3. **Refactor project management** out of engine.py into separate module  
4. **Refactor task management** out of engine.py into separate module

## Key Implementation Details

### File Discovery Module
Created `breeze/core/file_discovery.py` with:
- `FileDiscovery` class handling gitignore parsing
- Support for nested gitignore files
- Efficient file traversal with gitignore filtering

### Content Detection
`breeze/core/content_detection.py`:
- Uses hyperpolyglot for language detection
- Falls back to text encoding detection
- Replaces identify/libmagic dependencies

### Tree-sitter Integration
`breeze/core/snippets.py`:
- `TreeSitterSnippetExtractor` class with semantic extraction
- Proper query files for each language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust)
- Smart snippet extraction around search terms
- Handles large code blocks with truncation

### Reranking Implementation
Added to `engine.py`:
- Auto-selection of reranker based on embedding model
- Support for three reranker types:
  - Voyage AI (rerank-2)
  - Google Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash-lite)
  - Local cross-encoders (BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3)
- Configurable via environment variables

### Configuration Changes
`breeze/core/config.py`:
- Added: `reranker_model`, `reranker_api_key`
- Added: `embedding_batch_size`, `max_tokens_per_batch`
- Added: `get_reranker_model()` method with smart defaults

## Test Suite Status

### Working Tests
- `test_gitignore_filtering.py` - Comprehensive gitignore tests
- `test_reranking.py` - Tests for all three reranker backends
- `test_snippets.py` - Tree-sitter snippet extraction tests
- `test_rate_limiter.py` - Core TokenBucket tests
- `test_indexing_with_rate_limits.py` - Integration tests including file skip test

### Deleted Redundant Tests
- `test_rate_limit_fix.py`
- `test_simple_rate_limit.py`
- `test_final_rate_limit_fix.py`
- `test_rate_limiting_issue.py` (unique test moved to test_indexing_with_rate_limits.py)

### Known Issues
- Some rate limiting tests in `test_rate_limiting.py` are failing
- Need to ensure all tests use MiniLM model for faster execution
- Some tests have async cleanup warnings

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### Mock Detection Logic Issues
The engine had overly broad mock detection that was catching custom mock embedders:
- Fixed mock detection in `_rerank_local` method (line 553)
- Fixed mock detection in `embedder_task` method (line 881)
- Changed from `hasattr(self.embedding_model, '_model_name') and 'Mock' in type(self.embedding_model).__name__`
- To more specific: `type(self.embedding_model).__name__ in {'MagicMock', 'Mock'}`

### Test Performance Issues
- Tests taking 2+ minutes due to loading real models
- Even with mock embedders, real tokenizers were being loaded
- Fixed by ensuring mock reranker is properly used via `engine.reranker` attribute
- Added support for mock reranker in search method

### LanceDB Concurrency Issues
- Multiple concurrent writers causing transaction conflicts: "Retryable commit conflict"
- Fixed by setting `concurrent_writers: int = 1` in config.py
- LanceDB requires single writer to avoid transaction conflicts

### Background Task Cleanup Issues
- "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" warnings indicate improper async cleanup
- Added proper cleanup in engine shutdown for active indexing tasks
- Added auto cleanup fixture in conftest.py to cancel pending tasks after tests
- Fixed fire-and-forget task in `create_indexing_task` to store reference for cleanup

### MCP Server Issues
- Server startup showing LanceDB errors: "Spill has sent an error"
- Queue restoration is expected behavior - persisted tasks are picked up on startup
- Single writer limitation should resolve most concurrency errors

## Critical Files Modified

1. **engine.py**:
   - Integrated FileDiscovery for gitignore support
   - Replaced content detection with hyperpolyglot
   - Added TreeSitterSnippetExtractor integration
   - Implemented full reranking pipeline
   - Made batch sizes configurable

2. **config.py**:
   - Added reranker configuration
   - Added batch size configuration
   - Smart reranker model selection

3. **embeddings.py**:
   - Added pre-chunking for local models
   - Fixed Voyage token counting

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Embedding configuration
BREEZE_EMBEDDING_MODEL=voyage-code-3
BREEZE_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=your-voyage-api-key

# Optional reranker configuration
BREEZE_RERANKER_MODEL=rerank-2  # Auto-selected if not set
BREEZE_RERANKER_API_KEY=your-key  # Falls back to embedding API key
```

### Dependencies
Key additions to pyproject.toml:
- `gitignore_parser = "^0.1.11"`
- `tree-sitter-languages = "^1.10.2"`
- `hyperpolyglot-py = "^0.1.0"`
- Removed: identify, python-magic

## Next Steps for Cold Start

1. **Fix Remaining Test Failures**:
   - Check `test_rate_limiting.py` failures
   - Ensure all tests complete without warnings
   - Run full test suite to verify stability

2. **Semantic Chunking Enhancement**:
   - Use tree-sitter to identify function/class boundaries
   - Chunk at semantic boundaries instead of line counts
   - Preserve complete code units

3. **Refactoring Tasks**:
   - Extract search logic from engine.py â†’ search.py
   - Extract project management â†’ projects.py
   - Extract task management â†’ tasks.py
   - This will make engine.py more maintainable

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test categories
uv run pytest breeze/tests/test_gitignore_filtering.py -v
uv run pytest breeze/tests/test_reranking.py -v
uv run pytest breeze/tests/test_snippets.py -v

# Run remaining rate limiting tests
uv run pytest breeze/tests/test_rate_limiter.py breeze/tests/test_rate_limiting.py breeze/tests/test_indexing_with_rate_limits.py -v

# Clean up old tasks if MCP server has issues
rm -rf /tmp/breeze_data/code_index/indexing_tasks.lance
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Model Download**: Tests use sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for speed
2. **API Keys**: Mocked in tests using sys.modules patching
3. **Async Fixtures**: Use @pytest_asyncio.fixture for async fixtures
4. **Config Parameters**: Use `data_root` not `db_path`
5. **Rate Limiting**: Partial results are now returned instead of exceptions
6. **Test Timeouts**: 30s is reasonable for Python tests of this complexity
7. **Mock Embedders**: Use registry.get("mock-voyage") or registry.get("mock-local")
8. **Recursion Errors**: Can occur in async cleanup, fixed with auto_cleanup_pending_tasks fixture

## Architecture Notes

The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding new features:
- Gitignore filtering happens transparently during file discovery
- Content detection is a drop-in replacement
- Snippet extraction enhances existing functionality
- Reranking is optional and auto-configured

The modular design allows each feature to be tested independently and makes future enhancements easier.
